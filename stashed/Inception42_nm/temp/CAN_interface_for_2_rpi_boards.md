Setting up a CAN (Controller Area Network) connection between two Raspberry Pi 4B boards involves several steps. Here's a guide to get you started:

---

### **Prerequisites**

1. **Hardware:**
   - Two Raspberry Pi 4B boards.
   - Two CAN transceiver modules (e.g., MCP2515 or SN65HVD230).
   - Jumper wires for connections.
   - A 120-ohm resistor (if not integrated into the CAN module) for CAN termination.

2. **Software:**
   - Raspberry Pi OS (Debian-based, preferably Bullseye or Bookworm).
   - `can-utils` for testing and debugging CAN communication.

### **Step 1: Connect the CAN Transceiver**

The CAN transceiver bridges the Raspberry Pi and the CAN bus. For an MCP2515 transceiver:

1. **SPI Wiring:**
   Connect each MCP2515 module to the Raspberry Pi using SPI pins. Hereâ€™s the mapping:

   | MCP2515 Pin | Raspberry Pi Pin |
   |-------------|------------------|
   | VCC         | 3.3V (Pin 1 or 17) |
   | GND         | GND (Pin 6 or 9)  |
   | SCK         | GPIO11 (Pin 23)  |
   | SI          | GPIO10 (Pin 19)  |
   | SO          | GPIO9 (Pin 21)   |
   | CS          | GPIO8 (Pin 24)   |
   | INT         | GPIO25 (Pin 22)  |

2. **CANH and CANL:**
   - Connect the `CANH` pin of both transceivers together.
   - Connect the `CANL` pin of both transceivers together.

3. **Termination Resistor:**
   Add a 120-ohm resistor across `CANH` and `CANL` at both ends of the bus.

### **Step 2: Enable SPI on the Raspberry Pi**

1. Open the Raspberry Pi configuration tool:
   ```bash
   sudo raspi-config
   ```
2. Navigate to **Interface Options** > **SPI** and enable it.

3. Reboot the Raspberry Pi:
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

---

### **Step 3: Install Required Software**

1. Update your package list and install necessary tools:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install can-utils
   ```

---

### **Step 4: Configure CAN Interface**

1. **Load the SPI Kernel Module:**
   ```bash
   sudo modprobe mcp251x
   sudo modprobe can_dev
   ```

2. **Bring up the CAN Interface:**
   Replace `spi0.0` with the correct SPI device (check with `ls /dev/spi*`).

   ```bash
   sudo ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 500000
   sudo ifconfig can0 up
   ```

3. Verify the CAN interface:
   ```bash
   ifconfig can0
   ```

---

### **Step 5: Test Communication**

1. **On Board 1:**
   Send a CAN message:
   ```bash
   cansend can0 123#1122334455667788
   ```

2. **On Board 2:**
   Listen for CAN messages:
   ```bash
   candump can0
   ```

If the setup is correct, you should see the transmitted message on the second board.

---

### **Step 6: Debugging Tips**

- Check SPI connections carefully. Loose or incorrect wiring is a common issue.
- If `candump` shows no messages, verify the bitrate. Both devices must use the same CAN bitrate.
- Use a logic analyzer or an oscilloscope to monitor CANH and CANL signals if troubleshooting is needed.
