Ah, you're referring to the **Inception project** from 42 School, not the Lousa project. Let me clarify and focus specifically on **Inception**, which is a Docker-focused project from the curriculum. Here's a breakdown:

---

## **Inception Project Overview**

The **Inception project** is about learning **containerization** through **Docker**. It challenges you to create a functional multi-service architecture, simulating real-world web infrastructure. The main goals are to:

1. Understand Docker's basics and container orchestration.
2. Build services that interact seamlessly within containers.
3. Design a scalable and secure environment.

---

### **Project Scope**

You are required to:
- Use **Docker** to containerize various services.
- Set up a web server, database, and other services within isolated containers.
- Ensure that these containers interact correctly, mimicking production environments.

---

### **Key Steps**

1. **Setup Environment:**
   - Install Docker and Docker Compose on your machine.
   - Get comfortable with the Docker CLI.

2. **Break Down the Services:**
   - **Nginx Web Server:** Handles HTTP requests and serves web pages.
   - **MariaDB Database:** Stores and manages data.
   - **WordPress CMS:** A PHP application that relies on the web server and database.
   - **Custom Images:** Create your own Dockerfiles for each service.

3. **Use Docker Compose:**
   - Write a `docker-compose.yml` file to orchestrate multiple services.
   - Define networks and shared volumes for seamless communication between containers.

4. **Secure the Architecture:**
   - Use SSL/TLS certificates for encrypted communication (e.g., with Let's Encrypt).
   - Implement environment variables for sensitive data like database credentials.

5. **Optimize and Test:**
   - Ensure containers restart on failure (`restart` policy).
   - Validate that services can communicate on custom Docker networks.

---

### **Deliverables**

- **Functional Docker Setup:**
  - You should have a fully working environment, with all services running in isolated containers.
  
- **Well-Documented Codebase:**
  - Clear, structured `Dockerfile`s and a `docker-compose.yml` file.
  
- **Understanding of Concepts:**
  - During defense, you must explain how Docker works and why specific configurations were chosen.

---

### **Helpful Commands**

- **Building and Running Containers:**
  ```bash
  docker build -t <image_name> .
  docker run -d -p 80:80 <image_name>
  ```
- **Using Docker Compose:**
  ```bash
  docker-compose up --build
  docker-compose down
  ```

- **Debugging Containers:**
  ```bash
  docker ps
  docker logs <container_name>
  docker exec -it <container_name> bash
  ```

### **Tips for Success**

1. **Understand Docker Basics:**
   - Learn about images, containers, volumes, and networks.
   - Know how to create and manage Dockerfiles.

2. **Plan Your Architecture:**
   - Sketch out how the services will communicate (e.g., WordPress -> MariaDB -> Nginx).

3. **Practice Security:**
   - Avoid hardcoding sensitive credentials; use `.env` files instead.

4. **Test Incrementally:**
   - Build and test one service at a time before integrating them.

5. **Debug Like a Pro:**
   - Use logs (`docker logs`) and the `exec` command to troubleshoot issues.
